# ECON104
## Data Science for Economist class at UCLA, Fall 2023
Explore my repository showcasing project solutions from UCLA's Fall 2023 ECON 104 course, "Data Science for Economists," under the guidance of Professor Kimberly Boswell. Delve into regression models and their applications across cross-section, time-series, and panel data, unraveling complexities in Heteroskedasticity, Time-Series Analysis, Autocorrelation, Endogeneity, Pooled Regression, and more. Engage with three distinct project assignments, with Project 2 emerging as a personal highlight.
### Project 1
Delved into the Murder Rate Cross-Section data from 1950, meticulously examining and adjusting for heteroskedasticity within the model. Additionally, employed the RESET test to ascertain the model's functional form, ensuring robustness and accuracy in the analysis. 
### Project 2
Delved into the USGasB Time-Series data spanning 1950 to 1987, unraveling its narrative through statistical exploration. Unveiled the optimal model fit, discerning between AR and ARDL frameworks, and fine-tuned the autoregressive and distributed lag components. Ensured model robustness through rigorous stationarity tests and meticulously addressed any deviations. Scrutinized for autocorrelation to validate the model's integrity. 
### Project 3
Explored the Cigar Panel Dataset, which covers 46 different times between 1963 and 1992 and includes data from 1380 groups regarding cigarette consumption. Analyzed whether differences among the groups were best explained by a fixed effect or random effects model. Also delved into the credit card binary dataset, investigating whether individuals obtained a credit card or not. Determined the most suitable model—linear probability, probit, or logit—to describe the data accurately.
