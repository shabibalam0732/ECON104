# ECON104
## Data Science for Economist class at UCLA, Fall 2023
Explore my repository showcasing project solutions from UCLA's Fall 2023 ECON 104 course, "Data Science for Economists," under the guidance of Professor Kimberly Boswell. Delve into regression models and their applications across cross-section, time-series, and panel data, unraveling complexities in Heteroskedasticity, Time-Series Analysis, Autocorrelation, Endogeneity, Pooled Regression, and more. Engage with three distinct project assignments, with Project 2 emerging as a personal highlight.
### Project 1
Analyzed murder rate data from 1950, making sure to check and fix any issues caused by uneven variability in the data. Also, I figured out the best way to represent the relationship between variables in the model using a test called RESET.
### Project 2
Examined USGasB Time-Series data from 1950 to 1987. Determined whether the data could be modeled using an AR or ARDL approach. Identified the optimal degree for both autoregressive and distributed lag components. Ensured stationarity and corrected any deviations. Assessed for autocorrelation within the model.
### Project 3
Explored the Cigar Panel Dataset, which covers 46 different times between 1963 and 1992 and includes data from 1380 groups regarding cigarette consumption. Analyzed whether differences among the groups were best explained by a fixed effect or random effects model. Also delved into the credit card binary dataset, investigating whether individuals obtained a credit card or not. Determined the most suitable model—linear probability, probit, or logit—to describe the data accurately.
